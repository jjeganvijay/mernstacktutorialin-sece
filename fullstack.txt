fullstack=>
*doing both f.end and backend and devops
types of fullstack:
mern,mean,java fullstack,django,lampp,flask,kwiq,Android studio,flutter,gen ai(r (or) python)
intro to mern stack :
why we need to learn mern stack specifically?
*nessary components
*components based architecture
but angular also component based
mean components:
1.html

3.specifically
4.fuctionlity js/ts
what is the name of your tree in dom?
1.binary terre
2.avl tree
3.b/b+ tree
4.n-ary tree
r and d => research and development needsc to be done individually for us to learn mern

3 questions 
1.i am rectifiing a bug present in my game which version number i will update? patch/bug version
2.i am create a new feature , in this case which version number i will update?minor version
3.i am changing the architure of the game, which number i will update ? major version
versioning concept
1.major version
2.minor version
3.patch/beg version
whenever an archituctural change accuor then change first number and decimals also will change of the version number
types of version control system(vcs):
1.centralized vcs eg:fees paying 
2.distributed vcs eg:if i am the only one not payed the fee

now we have commited so we need to push to do that we need to create an repository
we go to github web and log our acc and create an new repo in some name then it will show two sets of code we use second set because we already have an repo ready 
areas of git 
1.local areas
2.staging area->before your first push it is called as coding area
3.github area
we reach staging area by using (git add)
then the git will know we are ready to push the files 
then we use (git push) to push the files 
[or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# mernstacktutorialin-sece" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jjeganvijay/mernstacktutorialin-sece.git
git push -u origin main
â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
(git remote add origin https://github.com/jjeganvijay/mernstacktutorialin-sece.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main)]
after that to push to the follow eg :
[C:\Users\JEGAN VIJAY\Desktop\HTML TUTORIAL>git remote add origin https://github.com/jjeganvijay/mernstacktutorialin-sece.git

C:\Users\JEGAN VIJAY\Desktop\HTML TUTORIAL>git push -u origin maste

  ->click on setting
  ->select ssh and geg key
  ->add the generatde id key inside your sshkey as a new key 
  3.click on save
  so,now
  mern2025->an folder inside that folder 
we have html_css/
then if mern2025 is repository 
then what is html_css/ ?
to ignore some files on the folders
[If mern2025 is a repository, then html_css/ is a subdirectory (folder) within that repository.

In the context of a version control system like Git, here's what that means:

mern2025: This is your root repository. It's the main folder containing all files and subdirectories that are tracked by Git.
html_css/: This is a subfolder within the repository that organizes specific files (in this case, likely HTML and CSS files). It could represent a particular section, feature, or component of your project.]
to ignore some files on the folders.......
